			<h1>Tell her she looks thin.</h1>
			<p>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
			<p>Do a flip! Bender?! <strong> You stole the atom.</strong> <em> And then the battle's not so bad?</em> I'm Santa Claus!</p>
			<h2>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</h2>
			<p>But I've never been to the moon! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? So, how 'bout them Knicks? I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. You are the last hope of the universe.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.</li>
				<li>Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."</li>
				<li>Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</h3>
			<p>For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! You lived before you met me?! That's not soon enough! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?</li>
				<li>Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.</li>
				<li>How much did you make me?</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Do a flip! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. You know, I was God once. No! Don't jump!</p>
			<p>Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.</p>
			<p>When will that be? What are their names? I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</p>
			<p>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Take me to your leader! Professor, make a woman out of me. Bender, you risked your life to save me!</p>
			<p>Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. File not found. No argument here. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p>
			<p>I don't want to be rescued. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?</p>
			<p>Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. File not found. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.</p>
			<p>I'm a thing. I had more, but you go ahead. Kif might! I'm a thing.</p>
			<p>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</p>
			<p>Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>
			<p>Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! How much did you make me? This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</p>

			<h1>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</h1>
			<p>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</p>
			<p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. You hit me with a cricket bat. <strong> The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.</strong> <em>…hey.</em> …the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>
			
			<h2>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</h2>

			<p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!</p>
			<p>Saving the world with meals on wheels. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</p>
